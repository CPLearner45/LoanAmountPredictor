# LoanAmountPredictor

This project is completed based on training models. I used three models here namely Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree algorithms(I didn't include the predicting values or LoanAmounts).
Finally Linear regression secured highest accuracy percentage of 81 followed by Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithm.
